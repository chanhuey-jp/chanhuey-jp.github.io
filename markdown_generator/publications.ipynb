The raw material of CuMn2O4/CuMnO2 was synthesized using co-precipitation method which is different with the Pechini method we have used in the previous study, aiming to a large-scale synthesis. The porous foam modules were prepared using polyurethane (PU) foam replica method. We investigated the sintering temperature and holding time as critical parameters affecting the mod­ ule’s mechanical strength, chemical reactivity, and durability. The optimal condition for CuMn2O4/CuMnO2based porous foam TCES module were identified as 1100 ℃ and 6 h. Our findings suggests that these modules are promising for the fixed-bed reactors in redox-type TCES systems.\"\tpaper-5\thttps://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1385894724010258\t\n",
      "2023-08-05\t\"An in-depth oxidation kinetic study of CuCr<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3) for thermochemical energy storage at medium-high temperature\"\tSolar Energy Materials and Solar Cells\tmanuscripts\t\"In this study, we investigated the effect of Cr doping on CuMn2O4/CuMnO2 and established an oxidation (heat release) kinetic model for CuCrxMn1-xO2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3) as an extension of our previous research on developing medium-high temperature (500–1000 ◦C) redox-type thermochemical energy storage materials. Our objective is to develop a reliable model for predicting the heat release power at constant temperature conditions. The asprepared samples were characterized using XRD Rietveld refinement, SEM-EDS, and XPS analysis to obtain a more precise crystal structure and elemental states. The oxidation kinetic model was established using an isothermal oxidation method which differs from the method (non-isothermal) used in the previous study. Additionally, the pressure term was also taken into consideration. The reaction models and kinetic parameters of CuMnO2, CuCr0.1Mn0.9O2 and CuCr0.3Mn0.7O2 were determined using master plots and Arrhenius plots. Among all sample, CuCr0.1Mn0.9O2 exhibited the smallest oxidation activation energy of 29.932 kJ/mol, which was significantly lower than the previous value obtained using the non-isothermal method. Combining the reaction rate and heat release, CuCr0.1Mn0.9O2 showed the highest instantaneous power output of 4.69 kW/kg at the oxygen partial pressure of 0.5.\"\tpaper-4\thttps://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0927024823003161\t\n",
      "2022-04-26\tEffect of Cr Addition on Cu–Mn Spinel/Delafossite Redox Couples for Medium-High Temperature Thermochemical Energy Storage\tACS Applied Energy Materials\tmanuscripts\t\"In this study, we developed Cu(CrxMn1−x)2O4/ CuCrxMn1−xO2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0) redox couples for medium-high temperature (500−1000 °C) redox-type thermochemical energy storage systems. Structural characterization, redox behavior, reoxidation behavior and kinetic analysis, heat storage capacity, and cyclability were investigated using SEM-EDS, XRD, TGA, and DSC, respectively. When x = 0−0.5, samples exhibited decreasing operating temperatures with increasing amounts of Cr, whereas they lost their reversibility when x > 0.5. R-CuCr0.1Mn0.9 and R-CuCr0.3Mn0.7 showed a faster reaction rate than R-CuMn because samples with small amounts of Cr required a lower activation energy (Ea) for reoxidation. The DSC results showed that a small amount of Cr improved the heat storage capacity of materials. In the cyclability test, the introduction of a small amount of Cr did not cause the deterioration of cyclic properties.\"\tpaper-3\thttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsaem.2c00178\t\n",
      "2021-07-08\tExploring Cu-Based Spinel/Delafossite Couples for Thermochemical Energy Storage at Medium-High Temperature\tACS Applied Energy Materials\tmanuscripts\t\"Cu-based spinel/delafossite couples with Mn and Fe as second cations were synthesized using the Pechini method for medium-high temperature thermochemical energy storage. Physicochemical properties of each sample were investigated. Only CuMn2O4/CuMnO2 exhibited favorable redox behavior in the range of 500−1000 °C. Cu-based delafossite can reoxidize at a lower temperature (∼600 °C), which may be related to the existence of a MO6 octahedra structure. Through the isothermal oxidation method, CuMn2O4/CuMnO2 couple showed a larger oxidation enthalpy of 258.32 ± 15.31 kJ/kg (1402.68 ± 83.13 kJ/L) than 190.35 ± 4.81 kJ/kg (1048.83 ± 26.50 kJ/L) of CuFe2O4/CuFeO2 couple. CuMn2O4 was chosen for further cyclability test with 20 cycles; the depth of reduction increased gradually and stabilized at 4% change in mass after 13 cycles.\"\tpaper-2\thttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsaem.1c01352\t\n",

Owing to the versatility of perovskite, Sr-based perovskites were investigated for redox-type thermochemical energy storage at medium-high temperature. In this study, SrCoO3-δ, SrFeO3-δ and SrMnO3-δ were prepared via a modified Pechini method. The oxidation enthalpy of each sample was measured using a combination of tubular furnace and DSC.
