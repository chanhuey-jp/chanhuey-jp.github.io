Our lab members and I presented our recent research on thermochemical energy storage and CO<sub>2</sub> capture at IMPRES2025, held in Sendai, Japan from Oct 27 to 30, 2025. The conference brought together researchers from around the world, and is was inspiring to exchange ideas and see the remarkable progress in the field.
