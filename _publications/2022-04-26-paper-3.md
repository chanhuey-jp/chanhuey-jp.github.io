In this study, we developed Cu(CrxMn1−x)2O4/ CuCrxMn1−xO2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0) redox couples for medium-high temperature (500−1000 °C) redox-type thermochemical energy storage systems. Structural characterization, redox behavior, reoxidation behavior and kinetic analysis, heat storage capacity, and cyclability were investigated using SEM-EDS, XRD, TGA, and DSC, respectively. When x = 0−0.5, samples exhibited decreasing operating temperatures with increasing amounts of Cr, whereas they lost their reversibility when x > 0.5. R-CuCr0.1Mn0.9 and R-CuCr0.3Mn0.7 showed a faster reaction rate than R-CuMn because samples with small amounts of Cr required a lower activation energy (Ea) for reoxidation. The DSC results showed that a small amount of Cr improved the heat storage capacity of materials. In the cyclability test, the introduction of a small amount of Cr did not cause the deterioration of cyclic properties.
