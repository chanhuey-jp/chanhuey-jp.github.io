In this study, we developed a novel CuMn2O4/CuMnO2-based honeycomb structure module for thermochemical energy storage applications. The honeycomb modules (φ 32 mm × H 49 mm, 304 cpsi) were prepared using an extrusion molding method. We investigated the effects of the initial reaction temperature (700, 600, and 500 °C) and gas flow rate (5, 2.5, and 1 L/min) on the module’s heat release performance and chemical reactivity during the oxidation process. Experimental results demonstrated a maximum outlet temperature change of 46.2 ± 4.1 °C and a thermal output power of 4.97 ± 0.49 W (97.99 ± 9.59 W/kg) under optimal conditions. In terms of chemical reactivity, the module achieved a maximum conversion ratio of 0.863 ± 0.007, showing excellent chemical reaction activity.
