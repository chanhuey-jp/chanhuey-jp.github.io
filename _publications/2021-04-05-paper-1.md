Thermochemical heat storage system exhibits extraordinary properties compared with sensible or latent heat storage system. Owing to the versatility of perovskite, Sr-based perovskites were investigated for redox-type thermochemical energy storage at medium-high temperature. In this study, SrCoO3-δ, SrFeO3-δ and SrMnO3-δ were prepared via a modified Pechini method. The oxidation enthalpy of each sample was measured using a combination of tubular furnace and DSC. Composition analysis, redox and cyclability tests revealed that SrFeO3-δ possesses favorable behavior validating the design principles.
