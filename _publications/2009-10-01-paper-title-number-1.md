excerpt: 'In this study, we developed a CuMn2O4/CuMnO2-based porous foam thermochemical energy storage (TCES) module, which is free from any supporting materials. The raw material of CuMn2O4/CuMnO2 was synthesized using co-precipitation method which is different with the Pechini method we have used in the previous study, aiming to a large-scale synthesis. The porous foam modules were prepared using polyurethane (PU) foam replica method. We investigated the sintering temperature and holding time as critical parameters affecting the mod­ ule’s mechanical strength, chemical reactivity, and durability. The optimal condition for CuMn2O4/CuMnO2based porous foam TCES module were identified as 1100 ℃ and 6 h. Our findings suggests that these modules are promising for the fixed-bed reactors in redox-type TCES systems.'
