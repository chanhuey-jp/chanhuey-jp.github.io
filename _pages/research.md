Research Scope
======
My research interests lie in gas-solid reacton thermochemistry, encompassing materials development, reaction kinetics, reaction module design, reactor design, and system optimization. 

Specifically, my works focus on thermochemical energy storage technologies for medium- and high- temperature applications, as well as calcium oxide-based CO<sub>2</sub> capture and utilization technologies. 

Additionally, I am interested in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials sciences and chemical engineering, particularly in high-throughput new material development, data-driven production process optimization, and system-level optimization.
