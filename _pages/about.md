I am currently a Project Researcher (Postdoctoral Fellow) at the Institute of Science Tokyo (formely Tokyo Institute of Technology), working in the Kato-takasu Lab [1](https://kato.zc.iir.titech.ac.jp/jp/index.html) & [2](https://sites.google.com/view/takasu-lab/) since April 2025. 

**Address:** Laboratory for Zero-Carbon Energy, Institute of Integrated Research, Institute of Science Tokyo (2-12-1-N1-22, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152-8550, Japan) 
**E-mail:** xiaoyu.c.2070[at-mark]m.isct.ac.jp; chen.x.av[at-mark]m.titech.ac.jp

I received my Ph.D. degree in Engineering (Major: [Chemical Systems Engineering](https://www.material.nagoya-u.ac.jp/Chemical_Systems.html)) from Nagoya University, Japan, in March 2025. My master (Master degree in Engineering, received in March 2022) and doctoral researches were conducted in the Kita-Kubota-Yamashita Laboratory [1](https://www.material.nagoya-u.ac.jp/nuce/L17/index.html) & [2](https://kubotam.jimdofree.com/)). 

My Ph.D. thesis focused on the development and demonstration of [an integrated redox-type thermochemical energy storage system for medium- to high-temperature applications](files/PhD_thesis.pdf). The reserach was supported by JSPS and jointly suprevised by [Dr. KITA Hideki](https://profs.provost.nagoya-u.ac.jp/html/100006380_ja.html) and [Dr. KUBOTA Mitsuhiro](https://profs.provost.nagoya-u.ac.jp/html/100002055_en.html). My thesis defense committee included [Dr. KOBAYASHI Noriyuki](https://profs.provost.nagoya-u.ac.jp/html/100001833_en.html), [Dr. MACHIDA Hiroshi](https://profs.provost.nagoya-u.ac.jp/html/100002257_en.html), [Dr. NAGANO Hosei](https://profs.provost.nagoya-u.ac.jp/html/100002226_en.html), and [Dr. HASEGAWA Yasuhisa](https://profs.provost.nagoya-u.ac.jp/html/100001973_en.html). 

I was born in Shashi, Jingzhou, a charming riverside (the Yangtze River) town in Hubei Province, located in the heart of China. At about the age of 12, I moved to Huadu, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, where I spent most of my adolescence. I later pursued my undergraduate studies in Huizhou, obtaining a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Huizhou University.

Research Scope
======
My research interests lie in gas-solid reacton thermochemistry, encompassing materials development, reaction kinetics, reaction module design, reactor design, and system optimization. 

Specifically, my works focus on thermochemical energy storage technologies for medium- and high- temperature applications, as well as calcium oxide-based CO<sub>2</sub> capture and utilization technologies. 

Additionally, I am interested in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials sciences and chemical engineering, particularly in high-throughput new material development, data-driven production process optimization, and system-level optimization.
