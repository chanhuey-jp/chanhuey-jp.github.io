I will receive my Ph.D. degree in Engineering (Major: [Chemical Systems Engineering](https://www.material.nagoya-u.ac.jp/Chemical_Systems.html)), Lab: Kita-Kubota-Yamashita Laboratory [1](https://www.material.nagoya-u.ac.jp/nuce/L17/index.html) & [2](https://kubotam.jimdofree.com/)) from Nagoya University, Japan at the end of March 2025. Starting in April of the same year, I will join the Kato-takasu Lab [1](titech.ac.jp/jp/about/index.html) & [2](https://sites.google.com/view/takasu-lab/) at Institute of Science Tokyo (formely Tokyo Institute of Technology), Tokyo, Japan, as a postdoctoral researcher.

My research interests lie in gas-solid reacton thermochemistry, encompassing materials development, reaction kinetics, reaction module design, reactor design, and system optimization. Specifically, my works focus on thermochemical energy storage technologies for medium- and high- temperature applications, as well as calcium oxide-based CO<sub>2</sub> capture and utilization technologies. Additionally, I am interested in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials sciences and chemical engineering, particularly in high-throughput new material development, data-driven production process optimization, and system-level optimization.
